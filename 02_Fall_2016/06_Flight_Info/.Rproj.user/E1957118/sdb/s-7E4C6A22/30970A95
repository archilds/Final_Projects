We have AFT model in lecture notes: Y = log(X)=mu+(beta^T)*Z + W(sigma). From the model we can see when Y does not change and W times sigma =0, we have mu+(beta^T)Z=0. Now, in our question Z is reduced by 5 and beta^T is -beta in our qusestion. We see beta is almost not change. And exp(-mu) is alpha, so alpha will change a lot. \n\n3.a) Use log-rank to test whether females and males have different survival curves. Is log-rank appropriate here?\n```{r}\n\nload(\"/Users/johnnyliu/Downloads/subsroi.RData\")\nhead(dd)\nfdata= dd[dd$gender==\"f\",]\nJ<-survdiff(Surv(day, status)~as.factor(gender), data=dd)\nJ\n\ncox.zph(coxph(Surv(day, status)~as.factor(gender), data=dd))\n```\nBoth the CoxPH and log-rank test need to have the proportational hazard assumption holds. From the proportational harzard assumption by cox.zph, we see the p-value = 0.438>0.05 which we see the proportational hazard assumption holds. Thus, log-rank test is appropriate.\n\n3.b) Use the univariate approach (for each R, but make sure including gender, R, and R×gender in the model) to screen for candidate predictors of the outcome, where R stands for each of the 113 candidate biomarkers. Report the top 5 biomarkers with the smallest p-values for R, and the top 5 for the interaction term R*×gender\n```{r}\n## univariate cox ph, \np.dd <- apply(dd[,4:116], 2, function(x) {\n  re <- summary(coxph(Surv(dd[,1], dd[,2])~as.factor(dd[,3]),data=dd))\n  return(re$logtest[3])  #extracting the pvalue\n})\n```",

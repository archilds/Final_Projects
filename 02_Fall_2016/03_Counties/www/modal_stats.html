<p>Here you may test different regression models using the data. First, select your regression model as either linear if you have a continuous outcome, or logistic if you choose a binary outcome variable. You may then choose to add any number of numeric and categorical explanatory variables from the dataset. Regression output will be automatically generated.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Linear Model, Outcome: % of County, Trump (2016), Explanatory Variables: % of County, Obese + % of County, Smoker + % of County, Excercise</li>
	<li>Logistic Model, Outcome: Winner 2016, Explanatory Variables: % of County, with Health Insurance + % of County, Unemployed + % of County, Black</li>
	<li>Linear Model, Outcome: % of County, Clinton (2016), Explanatory Variables: Drug Mortality Rate + Absolute Upward Mobility + Drug Mortality Rate</li>
</ol>

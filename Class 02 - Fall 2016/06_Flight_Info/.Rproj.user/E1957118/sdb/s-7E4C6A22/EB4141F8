Nevertheless, information about average fares charged, including fares charged by dominant carriers and lower-cost competing carriers where available, can provide useful consumer information. The fare comparisons between markets allow consumers to evaluate prices further and make the better purchase decision.\n\n##App Benefits:\nThe “Flight Information” app allows users to select the departure city and arrival city they are especially interested in, and to monitor the seasonal flight price fluctuation along with the fare information. Our goal is to assist users in making average fare comparisons from each selected quarter within a given year (or across different years) and to help users to plan out their travel schedules ahead of time.\n\nUsers could enter the departure and arrival city on the left-hand side of the app page, and the outputs under each tab would include the “Time Trend,” the “Departure Analysis”， the “Arrival Analysis” and the “Fare Analysis” respectively. By choosing from the year of 2011 through 2015 and each quarter in a year, the app would generate analytical graphs and tables under each result section that specifies the airline fare-related information.\n\nIn this app, we provide a general analysis and presentation of US domestic airfare and market share of dominant airline company based on arrival and departure cities from 2011 to 2015. This “Flight Information” app can be used for both academic research and market research purposes by airline corporate strategic planning department, aviation researcher, urban planning researcher and practitioners as well as national and district tourism bureaus. Our goal is to assist users in making average fare comparisons and to facilitate researchers and industry practitioners with urban design decision making, strategic pricing planning, and competitive market benchmark. \n\n##Data Source:\nEach year, the Department of Transportation releases a report provided information about average prices being paid by consumers in the 1,000 largest domestic city-pair markets within the 48 contiguous states. These markets account for approximately 75 percent of all 48 contiguous state passengers and 70 percent of total domestic passengers. This shiny app extracts the “table 6” from this report that lists all city-pair markets that average the passengers each day.\n\nWe have processed the raw data in several steps. First, we have used the “gsub” function to delete the additional brackets and to find the different departure city and arrival city. Second, we have used the “Geocode” package to search the longitude and latitude for each unique city. Finally, we have added the new column to list all the longitudes and latitudes for each departure and arrival city.\n                          \n##Departure Analysis:\nIn the section of departure analysis, the app generates four graphs that provide the statistical analysis on the average flight fare from departure city to different arrival destinations and the average passenger numbers from departure city to various arrival destinations. The graph descriptions are as the following:\n\n1. \"Average Fare\": The graph presents the average fare from departure city to other arrival cities with the fare listed on X-axis and each destination cities listed on Y-axis.\n\n2. \"Passengers Per day\": The graph shows the average passenger numbers from departure city to other arrival cities with the average passenger numbers listed on X-axis and each destination cities listed on Y-axis.\n\n3. \"Correlation\": We have conducted linear regression analysis on the relationship between travel miles and flight fare as well as the relationship between passenger numbers and flight fare respectively on each departure city. The correlation coefficient is labeled on both \"The Relationship Between Overall Avarage Fare and City Distance\" graph and \"The Relationship Between Overall Avarage Fare and Passengers Per Day\" graph.\n\n4. \"Carrier Market Share\": The graph indicates the total numbers of time when each flight company being the market share leader and the lowest fare provider for selected flight route. Regarding each flight carrier abbreviate, 9K represents the Cape Air, AA represents the American Airlines, AS represents the Alaska Airlines, B6 represents the JetBlue Airways, Co represents the Continental Airline, DL represents the Delta Airlines, F9 represents Frontier Airlines, FL represents the AirTran Airways, G4 represents the Allegiant Airline, NK represents the Spirit Airlines, SY represents the Sun Country Airlines, U5 presents the USA 3000 Airlines, UA represents the United Airlines, US represents the US Airways, VX represents the Virgin America and WN represents the South West Airlines.\n                          \n##Departure Visualization:\nIn the section of departure visualization, the app generates a map graph that lay out the route(s) with a various price ranges in a different color(s) from selected departure city to arrival cities. For each given departure city as the starting point, the arrow in this graph represents the route from selected departure city to arrival cities and each distinctive color matches particular average airfare range.\n\n1. Under the \"Complete Visualization\", users could see the original map graph that labels all the flight routes from selected departure city to various arrival cities and identify the defined price range as we labeled in different colors.\n\n2. Under the \"Fare-Filtered Visualization\", based on the first graph output, users could explicitly select one price range they are particularly interested in. The map would filter the user-selected price range from departure city to some arrival cities that may fall into that particular price range.\n                          \n##Arrival Analysis:\nIn the section of arrival analysis, the app generates four graphs that provide the statistical analysis on the average flight fare of arrival city from different departure cities and the average passenger numbers of arrival city from various departure cities. The graph descriptions are as the following:\n\n1. \"Average Fare\": the graph presents the average fare of arrival city from other departure cities with the fare listed on X-axis and each departure cities listed on Y-axis.\n\n2. \"Passengers Per day\": the graph shows the average passenger numbers of arrival city from other departure cities with the average passenger numbers listed on X-axis and each departure cities listed on Y-axis.\n\n3. \"Correlation\": We have conducted linear regression analysis on the relationship between travel miles and flight fare as well as the relationship between passenger numbers and flight fare respectively on each selected arrival city. The correlation coefficient is labeled on both \"The Relationship Between Overall Avarage Fare and City Distance\" graph and \"The Relationship Between Overall Avarage Fare and Passengers Per Day\" graph.\n\n4. \"Carrier Market Share\": the graph indicates the total numbers of the time for each flight company being the market share leader and the lowest fare provider. Regarding each flight carrier abbreviate, 9K represents the Cape Air, AA represents the American Airlines, AS represents the Alaska Airlines, B6 represents the JetBlue Airways, Co represents the Continental Airline, DL represents the Delta Airlines, F9 represents Frontier Airlines, FL represents the AirTran Airways, G4 represents the Allegiant Airline, NK represents the Spirit Airlines, SY represents the Sun Country Airlines, U5 presents the USA 3000 Airlines, UA represents the United Airlines, US represents the US Airways, VX represents the Virgin America and WN represents the South West Airlines.\n                          \n##Arrival Visualization:\nIn the section of arrival visualization, the app generates the map graph that lay out the route(s) with the various price ranges in different color(s) of selected arrival city from departure cities. For each given arrival city as the starting point, the arrow represents the route of selected arrival city from departure cities and each distinctive color matches particular average airfare range.\n\n1. Under the \"Complete Visualization\", users could see the original map graph that labels all the flight routes of selected arrival city from various departure cities and identify the defined price range as we labeled in different colors.\n\n2. Under the \"Fare-Filtered Visualization\", users could explicitly select one price range they are particularly interested in. The map would filter the user-selected price range of arrival city from some arrival cities that may fall into that particular price range.\n                          \n##Fare Analysis:\nIn this section, the app generates the graphs and tables that display the time trend analysis versus the fare for the selected flight route, along with the detailed baggage information. The descriptions of the figures and tables are as the following:\n\n1). \"Quarterly Time Trend Analysis in A Given Year\": the graph specifies three fare types - the average fare for all carriers, the average fare for the largest carrier as the market share leader and the average fare for the as the cheapest price provider quarterly in a given year.\n\n- Along with the graph 1, the app generates a table corresponding to the results. Table 1 lists all the carriers ordered by the largest as the market share leader to the lowest as the cheapest price provider quarterly in a given year. The baggage information for each unique carrier in the previous table is presented in a separate table accordingly. \n\n2). \"Time Trend Analysis in Selected Quarter Across Years\": The graph specifies three fare types - the average fare for all carriers, the average fare for the largest carrier as the market share leader and the average fare for the lowest carrier as the cheapest price provider in a selected quarter through the year 2011 to 2015.\n\n- Along with the graph 2, the app generates a table corresponding to the results. Table 2 lists all the carriers ordered by the largest as the market share leader to the lowest as the cheapest price provider in a selected quarter through the year 2011 to 2015. The baggage information for each unique carrier in the previous table is presented in a separate table accordingly. \n\n                          \n##Further Information:\nWe thank you for your time.

<p>Here you may upload your own dataset that can be analyzed along with the preuploaded election and health data. Datasets must match the following requirements:</p>
	
		<ol>
			<li>The data must be uploaded in a CSV format.</li>
			<li>The data must have a 5 digit county FIPS number. After uploading your file, you must specify which variable is your FIPS number. If your CSV drops the leading 0s for any county, these will be re-added by the dashboard</li>
		</ol>
	
<p>Simply upload your file, select your FIPS variable, and click the merge button. Your uploaded data and the full merged dataset will become visible on this page, and your variables will be added elsewhere in the dashboard. If the merged dataset does not appear, the upload was not successful and the app will need to be refreshed. A good source of county-level data is <a href = "https://www.data.gov/counties/" target = "_blank">"https://www.data.gov/counties/"</a>.</p>

- I like that when I first run this app it installs necessary packages. 
- For your Introduction, create a nice markdown document to describe things. You can then use 

`includeMarkdown("RMarkdownFile.rmd")`

- You may want to add a way for the user to load their own csv file into this so they can use excel data directly. 
- For help on this you can see the linear regression app fro mspring 2016 or the counties app from fall 2016.

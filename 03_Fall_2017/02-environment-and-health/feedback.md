## Initial Feedback 12-12-2017

- The app is looking good. 
- You have a lot of information contained in it. 
- The graphing functions on the first page seem slow to change, is this just my computer or have there been issues on your machine as well. 
- The Temperature variation map downloads but does not display properly. 
- For the air quality index, you may want to add a way to reset it. Once you start clicking cities the plots become very filled.

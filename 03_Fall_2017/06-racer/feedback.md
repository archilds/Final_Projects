## Initial Feedback 12-12-2017

- You will need to make sure you call all libraries before they are used. 
- `library(shinythemes)` should be called before the initial work. I added this in. 
- The app has a good start to it. You many want to use some css options on your page to adjust fonts and colors. 
- Could you include some sample csv files that I could upload to explore this more.

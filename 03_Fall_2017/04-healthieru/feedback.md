## Initial Feedback 12/10/2017

- This app looks like it will work well.
- A similar type app was done in Spring 2016.
    - You may want to use that as guidance
- To make this type of app work well pay attention to the visuals of it. 
- You have a lot of information on one tab. I would suggest a tabbed layout with maybe the following tabs:
      - Instructions
      - Enter Personal Information
      - BMI Analysis
      - Workout Analysis
- It runs well and looks good, your ggplot graphic does have the text boxes cut off on the right hand edges.

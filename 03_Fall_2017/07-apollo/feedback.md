## Initial Feedback 12-10-2017

- there are a lot of packages required for this which is fine except you really should automate the install of them first
- I will look at the app more when you automate this part. 



## Feedback 12-12

- App layout looks good. 
- Still wont run properly without me having to install a lot of packages.
